this file should label serial ata drives with "serial_ATA_*", parallel ata drives with "parallel_ATA_*", and USB hard disks with "USB_hdd_*"
in which the * is a number from 1 to 9 and all partitions of a same drive are given a same number

rule can be made by by using the ls -lR /dev/ command and having it look for id's of drives starting with "scsi-SATA" and "?-PATA?", and USB?
