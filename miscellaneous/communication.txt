This document contains some info on how to set up your communication with TAZ:
The main package that is used for this is gajim.
You can use this to communicate to other (linux) pc's that run gajim, or any other xmpp client 
(see https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html )
Given that even smartphones are able to run xmpp clients (i.e. AstraChat, Tigase Messenger), you should also 
be able to communicate with cellphone (smartphone) users.
Communicating with landlines is not possible.
You can also communicate with dumphones through the emailaccount 2 sms technique. To do this:
Combine your recipient's 10 digit phone number with one of the example domains below (domain depending on the cellphone 
provider your friend uses). If your friend's domain hasn't been listed, then contact your friends cellphone provider 
and ask the domain.

To send an email through an sms (i.e. if your friend wants to reach you from his dumphone this way), he will need to know the 
number to type in to be able to reach you (this will be a weird number). He can know this once he receives an SMS (through email)
from you. More info at https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-send-an-email-via-text-message-5506326
