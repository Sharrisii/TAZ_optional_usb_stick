TAZ github development:
If using github to contribute to the development of TAZ, then the best way to do this is via git-scm.
Using git via the palemoon browser is not recommended and often fails.
So use git-scm (along with ghi) for contributing to the TAZ and TAZ_optional_usb_stick repo.
Here's a quick review of the steps required:
* first, open sakura and cd to the folder in which you want the TAZ_optional_usb_stick copied to
* then do: git clone https://github.com/Sharrisii/TAZ_optional_usb_stick
* then cd into the TAZ_optional_usb_stick folder
* then cd to the folder in which there is the file(s) you want to modify, add or remove
* then open PCManFM at the same folder, and make the file(s) you want to add or modify an existing file
* then do: git add file1 file2 file3 ...
* then do: git commit or git commit -a (if multiple files)
* if you're the owner of the repo (which you are not) then you would normally do git push, however 
since you're a contributor, you can only do a "git request-pull oneofsharrisiiscommitversiontostartoffrom https://github.com/yourproject master
