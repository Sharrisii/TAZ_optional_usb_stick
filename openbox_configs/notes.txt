you should be able to see the keybinds list in conky due to the conky_files/conkyscripts/show_openbox_keybinds_list.sh script.
If you don't like the keybinds, you can alter the files in this folder directly, and again in show_openbox_keybinds_list.sh

Here's a list with the openbox keybinds, found in rc.xml:

Alt + F1: run dialog
Alt + F2: main menu
Alt + F3: client menu
Tab + rightarrow = next window
Tab + leftarrow: previous window
Ctrl + rightarrow: next desktop (pager)
Ctrl + Shift + rightarrow: sent item to next desktop
Ctrl + a: LXappearance
Ctrl + f: busybox finder
Ctrl + o: obConf
Ctrl + Alt + Del: LXTask
Alt + F4: close window
Super + f: file manager (PCManFM)
Super + t: terminal (Sakura)
Super + e: editor (leafpad)
Super + w: web browser (Pale Moon)
Super + c: source code editor (Geany)
PrtSc: snapshot (xwd)
Super + x: eXit

Notes: in rc.xml, Ctrl is "C", Alt is "A", Shift is "S", PrtSc is "Print", Super (windows key) is "W", rightarrow is "Right, 
leftarrow is "Left", downarrow is "Down", uparrow is "Up"
