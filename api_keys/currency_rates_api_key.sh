# Place your api key in this file; it will then get read by the currency rates api provider to attain the currency info for display 
# on conky. At the moment of writing, neither fixer.io (regular currency), nor binance 
# (https://api.binance.com/api/v1/ticker/allPrices ) requires an api key so this file is not yet needed. 
# Could be needed in the future, so that's why this file was made. Gold and silver (xaueur , xageur) rates are not yet provided.
