Place any downloaded binary packages here.
Binaries can be useful for programs you only rarely need and for which you don't want to take the time to compile and put into the 7th boot setup squashfs archive.
They are also useful for programs which are often updated and for which you really need the latest version.
An example of useful binaries are FireFox/Chrome binaries. These browsers are often updated, and some websites may have problems with Palemoon (even when running them using a different user agent).
Binaries of these can be downloaded (from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download , http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Linux).
Also, on binary package webhosts (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide ) you may find other binaries, but if using such binary webhosts, make sure you use trusted ones.
