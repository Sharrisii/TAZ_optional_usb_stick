Place any downloaded binary packages here.
Binaries can be useful for programs you only rarely need and for which you don't want to take the time to compile them to put into the 7th boot setup squashfs archive.
They are also useful for programs which are often updated and for which you really need the latest version.
An example of a useful binary is the FireFox binary. Browsers are often updated, and some websites may have problems with Palemoon (even when running them using a different user agent string).
Binaries compiled against musl however are difficult to find though (regular glibc binaries won't work in TAZ).
On binary package webhosts (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide ) you may find them, but make sure they are trusted binary webhosts.
